### Hallo, I am Serge ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜„ I work as a Partner Manager at 4AllBusiness Telecom B.V. and am the owner of the webagency SPIXO. In my free time, I like to develop new applications. I really like VoIP-telecom as it is my mainly business and I am sure I can help everybody with their Asterisk questions. 

# ðŸ”­ Where do I work on?
I am currently working on the new partner platform of 4AllBusiness Telecom B.V., a new billing software with various API integrations for GoedkoperVoIP and also some Saas-projects for my own business SPIXO. I am a back-end developer and front-end is really not my thing. I can just not match colors, find the right margins on buttons etc. Really not my thing, woops :P

# ðŸŒ± What am I currently learning?
I know the Laravel framework very good, but for now only with the blades. I am currently following some cursuses and doing new projects with Vue.js and the API. This really take a long time for me, as it is a completely new way to think about projects.

# ðŸ’¬ What can you ask me?
You can ask me anything that has to do with Laravel or Asterisk. I know Asterisk very well and have programmed various things with it. Don't ask me anything about Broadsoft, not my thing. Asterisk is the best!
